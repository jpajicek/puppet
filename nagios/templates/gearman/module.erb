# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care of
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to
# use hostgroups for easy configuration of your services.
# If set to yes, you still have to define which hostchecks should be
# processed by either using 'hosts' or the 'hostgroups' option.

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.

# When using encryption, you will either have to
# specify a shared password with key=... or a
# keyfile with keyfile=...
# Default is On.

# encryption of data pakets. Should be at least 8

# use_uniq_jobs
# Using uniq keys prevents the gearman queues from filling up when there
# is no worker. However, gearmand seems to have problems with the uniq

# are running.

# the following settings are for the neb module only and

# sets a list of hostgroups which will not be executed
# by gearman. They are just passed through.
# Default is none
localhostgroups=<%= @localhostgroups %>


# sets a list of servicegroups which will not be executed
# by gearman. They are just passed through.
# Default is none
localservicegroups=<%= @localservicegroups %>

# The queue_custom_variable can be used to define the target queue
# by a custom variable in addition to host/servicegroups. When set
# for ex. to 'WORKER' you then could define a '_WORKER' custom
# variable for your hosts and services to directly set the worker
# queue. The host queue is inherited unless overwritten
# by a service custom variable. Set the value of your custom
# variable to 'local' to bypass Mod-Gearman (Same behaviour as in
# localhostgroups/localservicegroups).
#queue_custom_variable=WORKER
<% if @queue_custom_variable %>
queue_custom_variable=<%= @queue_custom_variable %>
<% end %>

# Number of result worker threads. Usually one is
# enough. You may increase the value if your
# result queue is not processed fast enough.
# Default: 1
result_workers=<%= @result_workers %>


# defines if the module should distribute perfdata
# to gearman.
# Note: processing of perfdata is not part of
# mod_gearman. You will need additional worker for
# handling performance data. For example: pnp4nagios
# Performance data is just written to the gearman
# queue.
# Default: no
perfdata=<%= @perfdata %>

# perfdata mode overwrite helps preventing the perdata queue getting to big
# 1 = overwrote
# 2 = append
perfdata_mode=<%= @perfdata_mode %>

# The Mod-Gearman NEB module will submit a fake result for orphaned host
# checks with a message saying there is no worker running for this
# queue. Use this option to get better reporting results, otherwise your
# hosts will keep their last state as long as there is no worker
# running.
# Default: yes
orphan_host_checks=<%= @orphan_host_checks %>

# Same like 'orphan_host_checks' but for services.
# Default: yes
orphan_service_checks=<%= @orphan_service_checks %>

# When accept_clear_results is enabled, the NEB module will accept unencrypted
# results too. This is quite useful if you have lots of passive checks and make
# use of send_gearman/send_multi where you would have to spread the shared key to
# all clients using these tools.
# Default is no.
accept_clear_results=<%= @accept_clear_results %>
